"""Environment detection utilities for the Digital Forensics Workbench.

This module provides helper functions to gather information about
the host operating system and determine the availability of various
commandâ€‘line tools used throughout the project. By centralising
environment checks here we avoid duplicating logic in the GUI layer
and can easily extend the list of tools in the future.

Functions:
    check_environment() -> dict
        Returns a dictionary describing the current OS and the
        presence of key forensic tools on the PATH.
