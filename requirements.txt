# Optional Python dependencies for the Digital Forensics Workbench.
# These packages are not strictly required to run the GUI but enable
# additional functionality such as filesystem extraction and analysis.

# Python dependencies for the Digital Forensics Workbench.
#
# Note: `pytsk3` is not included by default because on Windows it
# requires Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools and precompiled wheels
# are not available for all Python versions.  The GUI and most
# functionality will work without it, but mounting disk images on
# Windows will be unavailable unless you install `pytsk3` separately
# or run the tool on Linux.  To install pytsk3 on Linux, you can
# usually install the OS package (e.g. `python3-pytsk3` on Debian/
# Ubuntu) or build it from source.

# Volatility3 is used for memory forensics.
